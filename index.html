                            <p>
                                As a graduate from my studies in Computer Engineering at the Northen Alberta Institute of Technology,
                                 I am a developer who has experience with a wide variety of tools. I've studied Web development,
                                Windows applications, programming Microcontrollers, Circuit building, Databases & SQL, IoT (Internet of Things), Datastructures and Algorithms.
                                These experiences have allowed me to become a well rounded developer and inspired me to continue learning new skills.
                                 I pursue creativity and maintain a positive attitude towards learning
                                in all aspects of my life. Taking a new idea, working at it, and building upon it until it becomes real 
                                - that satisfaction, is the reason I chose to become a Computer Engineer.
